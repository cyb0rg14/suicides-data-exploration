# **SUICIDES DATA EXPLORATION**

#### Firstly I have cleaned the data, in that process I removed the rows I thought of were no use.
#### Then I summairzed the columns I was gonna analyzed though that process I haven't showed on the notebook
#### And then finally I did analyze the summaried columns one by one




# **NOW LET'S PUT ALL THE POINTS TOGETHER WE HAVE COLLECTED FROM THIS DATASET:-**
1. Some countries like United States have seen drastically increase in suicidal rates over years whereas some countries like Germany have faced something completely opposite.
2. We can clearly see the men are most likely to be victim of suicides compare to women
3. There was a time around 2000's when suicide rate has increased at sudden rate but after that there is no relation between increase in suicidal_rate over time.
4. Age group plays the major role in suicides, to be more precise
  * Kids are almost save from these kind of accidents
  * But as kids grows they are more likley to be the victim
  * And as they become senior graphs are again falling down means they are less likely to be the victim
